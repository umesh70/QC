## Qubit

- A qubit is a quantum version of the classical binary bit. A classical bit can either be 0 or 1, whereas a Qubit can exist in states analogous to both 0 and 1.

- A qubit is a two state quantum mechanical system, meaning a qubit can exist in two distinct states simultaneously,which is not possible in classical bits, it is represented by a linear superposition of its two basis vectors ( ∣0⟩ , ∣1⟩ ).
- $ψ$ = $α∣0⟩+β∣1⟩$
- here ( ∣0⟩ , ∣1⟩ ) are represented by
- $|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}$
- $|1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

- **𝛼** and **𝛽** are complex coefficients that determine the probability amplitudes of the qubit being in each of the two states.
